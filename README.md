This is a short document containing a bunch of links related to my talk on flexagons that was given at the [20x2 Chicago](http://20x2chi.org/) event in October 2019.

**Committee members**

* [Arthur Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Harold_Stone)

  The creator of the flexagon was a considerable mathematician and topologist.

* [Bryant Tuckerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryant_Tuckerman)

  One of the members of the "flexagon committee", Tuckerman eventually worked on the Data Encryption Standard (DES).

* [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)

  Certainly the most successful of the four committee members, Feynman won the Nobel prize in 1965.

* [John Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey)

  Another successful mathematician, Tukey is credited for inventing the term "bit".

**More information** 

* [Martin Gardner's article on flexagons](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/pubs/focus/Gardner_Hexaflexagons12_1956.pdf)

  This is the first description of flexagons that brought the attention of the general public to the geometric shapes.

* [Flexagons at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexagon)

  Basic history and some links.

* [The Flexagon Portal](https://www.flexagon.net/)

  A bunch of printable flexagons of all types are available here.

  Use your face! Use someone else's face! And other things!
